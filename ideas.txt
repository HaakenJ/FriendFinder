## Using Firebase Realtime Database

- Each time a user enters their info, that info is uploaded to firebase in a
    group called 'friends'.
- Then, apiRoutes will pull all the friends from firebase
- apiRoutes compares the user's scores to all the scores in 'friends' 
    - apiRoutes makes sure that the closest match is not a user's own account
- Return the user's closest match and save that match's name in the user's 'matches' key

## Using Firebase Auth

- When a user is logged in using Google, they have the option to view their previous matches.

- They click the option to do so and a modal pops up with a list of all their previous matches


## Once firebase is implemented and users can be added.

- A match should only be returned if the user's preferences match.
    - user.gender === friend.preference
